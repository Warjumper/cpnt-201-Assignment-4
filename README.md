### Journal;

I chose to follow a tutorial (and a in-depth and lengthy one at that) instead of reworking some of my older code, because I wanted to build something from the groudnd up, instead of trying to reshape my other stuff. In adddition, I wanted something larger and far more complex to work with in an effort to better learn tailwind. This tutorial took me about 4.5 hours in total to work through, while skimming documentation and fixing my syntax errors. Overall, it was very helpful and has really shown me that tailwind can be used to quickly style things!

I really enjoyed this process.
